            <h2>Introduction to Debugging</h2>
            <p>Debugging is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing problems or "bugs" in code. It is a crucial skill for any programmer, as errors can occur at any stage of development.</p>

            <h3>Key Points:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Debugging helps ensure that your code functions as intended.</li>
                <li>Effective debugging can save time and reduce frustration.</li>
                <li>Understanding common debugging techniques is essential for efficient problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Types of Bugs</h2>
            <p>Bugs can arise from various sources, and understanding their types can help in debugging efforts.</p>

            <h3>Types of Bugs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> Mistakes in the code that violate the programming language's rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> Errors that occur while the program is running, often due to invalid operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Logic Errors:</strong> Flaws in the program's logic that lead to incorrect results, despite the code running without errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Debugging Techniques</h2>
            <p>There are several techniques that programmers use to debug their code effectively.</p>

            <h3>Common Debugging Techniques:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Print Statements:</strong> Inserting print statements in the code to track variable values and program flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging Tools:</strong> Utilizing integrated development environment (IDE) tools or debuggers that allow step-by-step execution and variable inspection.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubber Duck Debugging:</strong> Explaining your code or problem to an inanimate object to clarify your thoughts and discover issues.</li>

            <h2>Best Practices for Debugging</h2>
            <p>Effective debugging requires a systematic approach and good practices to minimize errors in the future.</p>

            <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always test your code in small increments to identify errors early.</li>
                <li>Keep your code organized and well-commented to facilitate easier debugging.</li>
                <li>Use version control systems to track changes and revert to previous states if necessary.</li>
